# Claude Development Guidelines

## CRITICAL: Always Test Your Code

**A task is NOT complete until you have actually run and tested the code.**

### Why This Matters
- Assumptions about how code works are often wrong
- Real-world environments have aliases, shell functions, and configurations that affect behavior
- Small syntax errors or logic bugs can break everything
- Users expect working solutions, not theoretical ones

### Testing Checklist
1. âœ… Run the exact command the user will run
2. âœ… Test with the same environment (check for aliases, shell functions)
3. âœ… Test edge cases and error conditions
4. âœ… Verify the output matches expectations
5. âœ… If you can't test directly, create a simulation that closely matches the scenario

### Example from This Session
In this session, I made multiple attempts to fix `claude -c` without actually running it:
- First attempt: Added `-i` flag (which doesn't exist)
- Second attempt: Removed the flag but didn't handle argument passing correctly
- Third attempt: Still had issues with permission-mode arguments

Only when pushed to actually test the code did I discover:
- The user has a `claude` alias that adds permission flags
- The shell function passes arguments in a specific way
- The arguments needed special handling to avoid duplication

### Best Practices
1. **Always run the code** before saying it's fixed
2. **Use debugging output** to understand what's actually happening
3. **Test incrementally** - verify each fix works before moving on
4. **Simulate user environment** when you can't test directly
5. **Don't assume** - verify!

## Remember
"It should work" is not the same as "It works" ðŸš€
